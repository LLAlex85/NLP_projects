Automatically generate captions from images.
*	[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Image_Captioning/Image_Captioning.ipynb)

This notebook is based on the programming assignment "CVND Image-Captioning-Project" of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. It was implemented in PyTorch and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 2.2. 

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given [here](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Image_Captioning/requirements.txt). The Python and deep learning library versions are:
- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow 2.2.0
