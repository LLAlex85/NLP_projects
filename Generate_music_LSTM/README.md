# Generate music with LSTM


[Generate music with LSTM](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Generate_music_LSTM/Generate_music_with_LSTM.ipynb): Build an LSTM network to generate music.

This project is based on the corresponding programming assignment of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 1.14.

## Requirements1
A full list of the requirements is given [here](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Generate_music_LSTM/requirements.txt). The Python and deep learning library versions are:
- Python 3.5.5
- TensorFlow 1.14.0
