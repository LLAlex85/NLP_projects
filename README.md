# RNN and LSTM networks using TensorFlow


The following projects are based on the programming assignments of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. They were implemented in Keras and I reimplemented them using TensorFlow.

* [Character level text generation with LSTM](https://github.com/vasilismg/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM): Build a character-level text generation LSTM network to generate new dinosaur names.

* [Generate music with LSTM](https://github.com/vasilismg/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Generate_music_LSTM): Build an LSTM network to generate music.

* [Trigger word detection using GRU](https://github.com/vasilismg/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Trigger_word_detection_GRU): Use GRUs for trigger word detection, thus a device can wake up upon hearing a certain word.

* [Word embeddings with LSTM](https://github.com/vasilismg/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Word_embeddings_LSTM): Implement an LSTM model which inputs a sentence in the form of word embeddings and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence.
