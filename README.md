# Natural Language Processing projects

My own implementations of various Natural Language Processing projects inspired by various online courses.


## Projects
* [Character level text generation with LSTM](https://github.com/vgkortsas/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM): Build a character-level text generation LSTM network to generate new dinosaur names.
	* [Jupyter Notebook (TensorFlow 1.x)](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM.ipynb)

* [Encoder-decoder architecture for language translation](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/tree/master/Encoder_decoder_language_translation): Build an encoder-decoder architecture (without attention mechanism) to translate sentences from English to French.

* [Image Captioning](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/tree/master/Image_Captioning): Automatically generate captions from images.

* [Generate music with LSTM](https://github.com/vgkortsas/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Generate_music_LSTM): Build an LSTM network to generate music.

* [Trigger word detection using GRU](https://github.com/vgkortsas/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Trigger_word_detection_GRU): Use GRUs for trigger word detection, thus a device can wake up upon hearing a certain word.

* [Word embeddings with LSTM](https://github.com/vgkortsas/RNN_LSTM_TensorFlow/tree/master/Word_embeddings_LSTM): Implement an LSTM model which inputs a sentence in the form of word embeddings and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence.

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given for each project separately. The deep learning libraries used in the projects are TensorFlow 2.2, TensorFlow 1.x and Keras.
