# Encoder-decoder architecture for language translation

## Project description
Build an encoder-decoder architecture, **without attention mechanism**, to translate sentences from English to French. 

This project is based on the programming assignment "Machine translation" of the Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.

# Implementation
