# Word embeddings with LSTM


[Word embeddings with LSTM](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Word_embeddings_LSTM/Word_embeddings_LSTM.ipynb): Implement an LSTM model which inputs a sentence in the form of word embeddings and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence.

This project is based on the corresponding programming assignment of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 1.14.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5.5
- TensorFlow 1.0.0
