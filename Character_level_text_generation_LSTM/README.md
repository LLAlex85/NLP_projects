# Character level text generation with LSTM

## Project description
Build a character-level text generation LSTM network to generate new dinosaur names. 

This project is based on the corresponding programming assignment of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 1.14.

## Implementation
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM.ipynb)

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given [here](https://github.com/vgkortsas/NLP_projects/blob/master/Character_level_text_generation_LSTM/requirements.txt). The Python and deep learning library versions are:
- Python 3.5.5
- TensorFlow 1.14.0
